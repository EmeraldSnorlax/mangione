<h1>About</h1>
<p>On the 4th December 2024, Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth, was shot.</p>
<p>
	The internet's reaction to this was chaotic. Misinformation rapidly spread as people <a
		href="https://time.com/7201952/luigi-mangione-internet-myths-essay/"
		>cherry picked pieces of Luigi Mangione</a
	> to try and make sense of him; a person with motives that seemingly didn't fit into any coherent ideology.
</p>

<p>
	Media publications and influencers, particularly right-wing leaning ones, were quick to condemn
	the murder. Ben Shapiro, for example, was quick to ascribe tolerance of it as being an <a
		href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeRnWYn-GTQ">'evil leftist revolutionary'.</a
	>
</p>

<p>
	However, readers and viewers of those publications responded poorly, as can be seen with the
	comments under the above video.
</p>

<p>
	This has been one of the few times when a large amount of conservative Americans have rejected
	right-wing media and shown anything approaching class consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Many people on social media from both sides of the political aisle felt a sense of schadenfreude
	about the murder.

		>Luigi Mangione is hard to pin down politically.</a
	> But perhaps this is what makes him so appealling to many?
</p>

<p>
	You could conveniently filter out parts that you didn't agree with, and project your own morality
	onto Mangione. In most cases, this was already done for you by the publications and people you
	follow.
</p>

<p>The aftermath of the assasination of Brian Thompson has been a time when it became common (and even socially popular) to openly and loudly disagree with the ethics we've been taught about something as seemingly universally shunned as murder.</p>

<p>
	Our media diets have an immense impact on our view of the world. We live in a highly polarised
	political climate, where how much something resonates with you is often more important than how
	true it is.
